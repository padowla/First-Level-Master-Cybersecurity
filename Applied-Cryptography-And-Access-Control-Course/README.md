# Applied Cryptography and Access Control
CIA requirements: confidentiality, integrity, authentication. Symmetric encryption. Perfect ciphers: onetime pad. Block ciphers, mention of DES and AES. Encryption modes: electronic codebook (ECB)
and Cipher Block Chaining. Multiple encryption: 3DES. The hash functions and message authentication code
(MAC). Public key cryptography. The RSA cipher. The digital signature, certificates and infrastructure
public key encryption (PKI). The Diffie-Hellmann key exchange. Authentication and identification.
Access control. The access control matrix: capabilities and ACLs. The models
discretionary, mandatory and role-based.
